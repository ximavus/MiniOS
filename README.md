# MiniOS
Simple OS I'm making. Inspired and got the boot files from @mell-o-tron's OS-Reference and a bit of IO from his MellOs project.
Probably gonna change the name until it feels nice
## To run
do `sh run.sh` in linux to compile for changes.
If you don't have a cross compiler and don't want to make changes just run the run.sh's last line.
If it pops an error you need to download qemu with `sudo apt install qemu-system-x86_64`
